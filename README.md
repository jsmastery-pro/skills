# Engineering Workflow Skills

A set of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) that take a change from a vague idea to shipped, verified, documented code, for any AI coding agent. One skill per phase. Run only the ones a change needs, in any order.

The state lives in files (a scope, ADRs, AGENTS.md, tests), not in a chat session. So work survives across sessions, picks up where it left off, and works for a whole team.

```
idea → /scope → /audit → /architect → /develop → /check verify → /test → /check review → /document → /sync
```

Run `/debug` anytime something breaks. Run a bare `/scope` anytime to see where things stand.

## The skills

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `scope` | Turns a product idea into a living, coarse scope and keeps it current as you ship. |
| `audit` | Writes the AGENTS.md context files every other skill reads. |
| `architect` | Makes a load bearing decision and writes it as a build spec ADR in `docs/adr/`. |
| `develop` | Builds a feature, UI or backend, from its ADR. Gates to `/architect` if a decision is owed. |
| `check` | Confirms a change before merge. `/check verify` runs the real app; `/check review` reads the code on a second model. |
| `test` | Writes a test suite for the code you just changed. |
| `document` | Writes the PR text, changelog, release note, or postmortem from the real diff. |
| `sync` | Keeps AGENTS.md, the scope, and ADR statuses current after a change. |
| `debug` | Finds and fixes the root cause of a bug, then hands a regression test to `/test`. |

Hardening (systems level failure mode analysis) is temporarily removed and will return as a system design specialization.

## Install

Uses [npx skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills). Pick your agent:

```bash
# Claude Code (installs into .claude/skills, then restart Claude Code)
npx skills@latest add JavaScript-Mastery-Pro/skills -a claude-code

# Generic .agents/skills, read by Codex and other agents
npx skills@latest add JavaScript-Mastery-Pro/skills
```

Works on any Agent Skills client (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, and [more](https://agentskills.io/clients)). Commit the installed skills folder to share the workflow with your team.

## Where to start

**New product (greenfield):** `/scope` the idea, then `/architect` the stack, then scaffold the project, then `/audit` to seed AGENTS.md from the real project, then the feature loop. The stack is decided and the project scaffolded before `/audit` runs, so it reads a real project, not an empty one.

**Existing codebase (brownfield):** `/audit` first so every skill understands your project, then `/scope` the next slice on top of what exists, then the feature loop.

**Any single change:** run only what it needs. A bug goes straight to `/debug`. A small change can be `/develop` then `/check verify`.

**Monorepo:** everything scopes to the target workspace, which has its own AGENTS.md, scope, stack, and commands.

### The feature loop

```
/architect → /develop → /check verify → /test → /check review → /document → /sync
```

`/scope` fixes what to build. `/architect` designs how, as an ADR whose acceptance criteria are the contract; every later step traces back to that contract. `/develop` gates on the ADR: if building would mean inventing an undecided design, provider, or data model, it stops and sends you to `/architect` first.

## What gets written, and where

| Artifact | Path | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | `docs/scope/` | scope |
| ADRs | `docs/adr/` | architect |
| Context files | AGENTS.md (plus a thin CLAUDE.md pointer) | audit, kept current by sync |
| Design system | `design.md` (art direction; token values live in CSS) | develop |
| Review findings | `docs/reviews/` | check |
| Tests | your test dirs | test |
| App code | your source tree | develop |
| Human docs | PR body, CHANGELOG.md, `docs/releases/`, `docs/postmortems/` | document |

If `docs/` is a published docs site, these move to `.workflow/` so they do not ship with your site. Because state lives in files, each skill suggests `/clear` at handoffs, so a fresh session re-reads from disk and long chats do not pile up cost.

## Skill reference

For each skill: what it does, and when to run it.

**scope**: Turns an idea into a living, coarse plan of what to build, in order.
When: to start a new product or plan the next slice. Greenfield: run it first. Brownfield: it enrolls what already exists, then plans the new work. Monorepo: writes one scope per workspace.

**audit**: Writes the AGENTS.md context files that give every skill your project's stack, commands, and conventions.
When: brownfield, run it first. Greenfield, run it after the stack is chosen and the project is scaffolded. Monorepo: gives each workspace its own nested AGENTS.md.

**architect**: Runs a deep design conversation and writes the decision as a build spec ADR.
When: a load bearing choice is unmade (a stack, a data model, a provider, a page design), or `/develop` says a decision is owed. Greenfield: it decides the stack first. Monorepo: reads the target workspace's stack.

**develop**: Builds a feature, UI or backend, from its ADR, runs migrations, and advances the scope.
When: after the decision exists. It gates to `/architect` if a design is owed. Monorepo: builds inside the target workspace using its commands.

**check**: Confirms a change before merge, in two modes.
When: `/check verify` after `/develop` to run the real app and prove the feature works against the spec; `/check review` before a PR for a senior review on a different model than wrote the code. Any project type.

**test**: Writes a senior test suite for your uncommitted change and saves your framework choice.
When: after building a feature or fixing a bug. Monorepo: resolves the framework per package.

**document**: Writes the human facing prose (PR, changelog, release note, postmortem) from the real diff.
When: a finished change needs writing up. Any project type.

**sync**: Reconciles AGENTS.md, the scope, and ADR statuses to what the repo now shows.
When: the last step around merge. Monorepo: reconciles the right workspace.

**debug**: Runs a disciplined root cause loop and hands a regression test to `/test`.
When: anytime something is failing, throwing, or behaving wrong. Not tied to project type.
